# Project Rules

## Planning

- When using plan mode, plans must be written in actionable steps, with each step having a verification task.
- Ask clarifying questions to resolve ambiguities **before** finalizing a plan and requesting approval.
- Upon plan approval, the **first action** is always to create or update a `<plan-name>.md` file in the `./planning/` directory.
- As work progresses, check off completed and verified items in the local plan file to keep it in sync with the current state.
